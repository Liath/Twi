Twi is a danbooru clone written on Node.js/Express and Bootstrap
----------------------------------------------------------------
Basic functionality is present but I would at best put the project at an early beta status.

The comments, notes, artists, and tags sections haven't been touched but the stuff that involves them in the other tabs is essentially done, they just need routes and templates.

### Features Implemented:
- Transparent Imgur storage

### Planned:
- Similar transparent support for AWS
- File hashing to prevent duplicate posts (Is only available on direct storage mode currently.)
- A setup script
- Admin functionality (It's currently nonexistant)
