Twi is a danbooru clone written on Node.js/Express and Bootstrap
----------------------------------------------------------------
[ ![Codeship Status for Liath/Twi](https://codeship.com/projects/d6af8d80-4fec-0133-ab42-6a4e3a7a7098/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/107457)
Basic functionality is present but I would at best put the project at an early beta status. (Now working on Heroku Cedar-14!)

The comments, notes, artists, and tags sections haven't been touched but the stuff that involves them in the other tabs is essentially done, they just need routes and templates.

### Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/Liath/Twi.git twi
cd twi
nano settings.js # Configure to your needs
# If you're running with local storage:
npm start
# If you're using something like heroku, you'll need to get the settings into the
# TWI_SETTINGS environment variable. Here's a complete Heroku setup.
heroku create
heroku config:set TWI_SETTINGS=`node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify(require('./settings.js')));"`
heroku git:remote
git push heroku
```

### Features Implemented:
- Transparent Imgur storage

### Planned:
- Similar transparent support for AWS
- File hashing to prevent duplicate posts (Is only available on direct storage mode currently.)
- A setup script
- Admin functionality (It's currently nonexistant)
