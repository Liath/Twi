Twi is a danbooru clone written on Node.js/Express and made pretty with Bootstrap.

Basic functionality is present but a lot of it still needs work.
As of now, account creation, uploading, and commenting are pretty much it.


Features: (Above the basic stuff)
Implemented:
Transparent Imgur storage

Planned:
Similar transparent support for AWS
File hashing to prevent duplicate posts (Is only available on direct storage currently.)
A setup script
